NAME
    Brickyard - Plugin system based on roles

VERSION
    version 1.111070

SYNOPSIS
        use Brickyard;
        my $brickyard = Brickyard->new(base_package => 'My::App');
        my $root_config = MyApp::RootConfig->new;
        $brickyard->init_from_config('myapp.ini', $root_config);
        $_->some_method for $brickyard->plugins_with(-SomeRole);

DESCRIPTION
    This is a lightweight plugin system based on roles. It does not use
    Moose but relies on "Role::Basic" instead, and very few other modules.

    It takes its inspiration from Dist::Zilla, but has much less flexibility
    and therefore is also much less complex.

METHODS
  new
    Constructs a new object. Takes an optional hash of arguments to
    initialize the object.

  base_package
    Read-write accessor for the base package name that is used in
    "expand_package()". Defaults to "MyApp".

  parse_ini
    Takes a string that contains configuration in "INI" format and parses it
    into an array of configuration sections. It returns a reference to that
    array.

    Using an array, as opposed to a hash, ensures that the section order is
    preserved, so we know in which order to process plugins in Brickyard's
    "plugins_with()" method.

    Each array element corresponds to an "INI" section. Each section is
    itself a reference to an array with three elements:

    The first element is the section name. The second element is the package
    name of the plugin; it is obtained by expanding the section name using
    "expand_package()". The third element is a reference to a plugin
    configuration hash; it is the section's payload. If a section payload
    key occurs several times, it is turned into an array reference in the
    plugin configuration hash.

    The first section is the global section, denoted by the name "_". Any
    payload in the "INI" configuration that occurs before the first section
    ends up in this section.

    For example:

        ; A comment
        name = Foobar

        [@Default]

        [Some::Thing]
        foo = bar
        baz = 43
        baz = blah

    is parsed into this structure:

        [ '_',        'MyApp::Plugin::_',             { name => 'Foobar' } ],
        [ '@Default', 'MyApp::PluginBundle::Default', {} ],
        [   'Some::Thing',
            'MyApp::Plugin::Some::Thing',
            {   'baz' => [ '43', 'blah' ],
                'foo' => 'bar'
            }
        ]

    What if you want to pass more complex configuration like a hash of
    arrays? An "INI" file is basically just a key-value mapping. In that
    case you can use a special notation for the key where you use dots to
    separate the individual elements - array indices and hash keys. For
    example:

        foo.0.web.1  = bar
        foo.0.web.2  = baz
        foo.0.mailto = the-mailto
        foo.1.url    = the-url

    And this would be parsed into this structure:

        foo => [
            { web    => [ undef, 'bar', 'baz' ],
              mailto => 'the-mailto',
            },
            { url => 'the-url' }
        ]

  expand_package
    Takes an abbreviated package name and expands it into the real package
    name. "INI" section names are processed this way so you don't have to
    repeat common prefixes all the time.

    If "@" occurs at the start of the string, it is replaced by the base
    name plus <::PluginBundle::>.

    A "-" is replaced by the base name plus "::Role::".

    A "=" is replaced by the empty string, so the remainder is returned
    unaltered.

    If the package name still hasn't been altered by the expansions
    mentioned above, custom expansions are applied; see below.

    As a fallback, the base name plus "::Plugin::" is prepended.

    The base name is normally whatever "base_package()" returns, but if the
    string starts with "*", the asterisk is deleted and "Brickyard" is used
    for the base name.

    A combination of the default sigils is not expanded, so "@=", for
    example, is treated as the fallback case, which is probably not what you
    intended.

    Here are some examples of package name expansion:

        @Service::Default     MyApp::PluginBundle::Service::Default
        *@Filter              Brickyard::PluginBundle::Filter
        *Filter               Brickyard::Plugin::Filter
        =Foo::Bar             Foo::Bar
        Some::Thing           MyApp::Plugin::Some::Thing
        -Thing::Frobnulizer   MyApp::Role::Thing::Frobnulizer

    You can also define custom expansions. There are two ways to do this.
    First you can pass a reference to an array of expansions to the
    "expand()" method, or you can define them using the "expand" key in the
    configuration's root section. Each expansion is a string that is
    evaluated for each package name. Custom expansions are useful if you
    have plugins in several namespaces, for example.

    Here is an example of defining a custom expansion directly on the
    Brickyard object:

        my $brickyard = Brickyard->new(
            base_package => 'My::App',
            expand       => [ 's/^%/MyOtherApp::Plugin::/' ],
        );

    Here is an example of defining it in the configuration's root section:

        expand = s/^%/MyOtherApp::Plugin::/

        [@Default]

        # this now refers to MyOtherApp::Plugin::Foo::Bar
        [%Foo::Bar]
        baz = 44

  init_from_config
    Takes configuration and a root object, and an optional callback. For
    each configuration section it creates a plugin object, initializes it
    with the plugin configuration hash and adds it to the brickyard's array
    of plugins.

    Any configuration keys that appear in the configuration's root section
    are set on the root object. So the root object can be anything that has
    set-accessors for all the configuration keys that can appear in the
    configuration's root section. One exception is the "expand" key, which
    is turned into a custom expansion; see above.

    If the configuration is a string in "INI" format, it is parsed. It can
    also be a configuration structure as returned by "parse_ini()" or a
    plugin bundle's "bundle_config()" method.

    If an object is created that consumes the Brickyard::Role::PluginBundle
    role, the bundle is processed recursively.

    If the callback is given, each value from a key-value pair is filtered
    through that callback. For example, you might want to support
    environment variable expansion like this:

        $brickyard->init_from_config(
            'myapp.ini',
            $root_config,
            sub {
                my $value = shift;
                $value =~ s/\$(\w+)/$ENV{$1} || "\$$1"/ge;
                $value;
            }
        );

  plugins
    Read-write accessor for the reference to an array of plugins.

  plugins_with
    Takes a role name and returns a list of all the plugins that consume
    this role. The result is cached, keyed by the role name.

  plugins_agree
    Takes a role name and a code reference and calls the code reference once
    for each plugin that consumes the role. It returns 1 if the code returns
    a true value for all plugins, 0 otherwise.

    An example will make this clearer:

        # Let the plugins decide
        sub value_is_valid {
            my ($self, $value) = @_;
            $self->brickyard->plugins_agree(-ValueChecker =>
                sub { $_->value_is_valid($value) }
        }

  reset_plugins
    Clears the array of plugins as well as the cache - see "plugins_with()".

  expand
    Holds custom package name expansions; see above.
